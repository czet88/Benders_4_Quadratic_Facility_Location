##SAHLP- Benders decomposition applied to the SAHLP

This repository contains an implementation of the algorithm presented in the manuscript "An exact algorithm for large-scale non-convex quadratic facility location" by Contreras, Zetina, and Jayaswal.

Currently the code is catered to solve instances of single-assignment hub location problems by reading the input files having the AP format. 

In addition the code includes a series of scripts to execute the project in Linux and Windows.
